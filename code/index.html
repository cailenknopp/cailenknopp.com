            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>Hi there. My name is Cailen Knopp and it would appear you’ve stumbled upon my website (perhaps even on perhaps!). In any case of your arrival, welcome. This is my biography.     
            <br>
            <br>
            I am not really sure what to write for my biography. I’m only sixteen years old. In the time in which I am not confined to my under-renovation high school, I’m usually curling. Traveling around the southernmost region of my province and playing against other curlers in the hope of winning a small pool of money has kind of become the norm. Sometimes I even win! Curling is a big part of my life and such I budget a lot of time doing so. Another use of my time outside of school and school related work is computers (I know ‘computers’ is a noun and not a verb but just stay with me). I like to learn new programming languages and make little program things to run on my computer. One day, two years ago, I made my computer say <i>Hello World</i>, and since then I’ve been making it say other things. You can check out my GitHub <a href="https://github.com/cailenknopp"> here</a> and  I will put some of my code up there (however, I many not be bothered to).
            <br>I hope you enjoyed my biography, thanks for reading.
            <br>- Cailen
